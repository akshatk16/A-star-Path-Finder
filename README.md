# A* Path Finding Algorithm
A visualisation for **A\* Path Finding Algorithm** using P5.JS which finds the shortest path from the top left of the grid to the bottom right. The algorithm is an informed search algorithm and works using weighted graphs. It aims to find a path to the destination from the starting node with the least cost.

# Usage
- The algorithm starts itself when the page loads.
- If you get an alert saying **No Path from start to end**, press **Try Again** to randomise the grid and start over.
- If shortest path is available, the algorithm ends and displays the shortest path in blue. Press **Try Again** to randomise the grid and start over.

# What I learnt
- p5.js sketch and draw loop
- Path finding algorithms
- Weighted graphs
- Graph Traversal
- Visualisation
